<h3> About Project </h3>
  
  <img src="Screen Shot 2021-04-23 at 1.10.57 PM.png">
  <p> This is an interactive pacmen exercise that populates pacmen on the screen per the users click of a mouse. Then when ready, the user can click play and the pacmen will move around, bouncing off the walls when the limits of the screen are reached. A starter code was provided and the rest we coded on our own using javascript, css, and html.</p>
